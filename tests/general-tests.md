# General Tests

This folder help organizes tests that are not specific to a route.

For QA, perhaps you can use the `play` as away to conduct unit tests. Just don't import and use texts.
You can disable this by checking out svelte.config.ts and place `.storybook` in exclude, and remove it from the `include`.
