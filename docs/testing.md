# Testing

There are multiple ways we can test our products

For front-end developers and designers, simply use storybook as it creates a platform for you to tests GUI.

To execute story book execute the following command to boot it up, then you can go to `http://localhost:6006/`.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

For back-end developers, simply use vitest.

```bash
npm run test
